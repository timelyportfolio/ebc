There are a number of statistically significant determinants of participation. Two of the three economic variables„ income and land„are statistically significant. Households with supplementary income in addition to their income from agriculture are more likely to participate in user groups created by the PPP (coefficient = 0.477, significant at the 10% level). Similarly, households that own more land are more likely to participate to a greater extent in the groups created by the program (coefficient = 0.004, significant at the 5% level). Both the social variables are statistically significant. The high statistical significance of the caste variable confirms the hypothesis that lower-caste members participate relatively less in the user groups created by the PPP (coefficient = 0.554, significant at the 1% level). The education variable has a negative sign and is statistically significant (coefficient = -0.012, significant at the 5% level). This indicates that the higher the average number of years of education of the adult members in a household, the lower the likelihood of the household participating in the program.Of the two variables related to benefits from the resource (firewood and fodder), firewood is statistically significant. This means that as anticipated, households that use higher amounts of firewood from the forest are also more likely to try to participate in the program and to influence decision making in local groups through participation (coefficient = 0.1, statistically significant at the 5% level).

In essence, the programs are intended to achieve these twin goals by incentivizing local communities to manage state forests. However, there are pervasive imperfections in forest products markets that constrain the needed incentives; these imperfections arise mainly from limited infrastructure, high transport costs, few buyers, exploitive marketing chains and imperfect price information. One innovative approach to overcome these problems, which has been adopted by the Ethiopian government, is to organize JFM into community forest enterprises (CFE) in the form of forest usersÍ cooperatives (FUC) for forest products marketing.4 This provides the community with avenues for greater participation in value chains of forest products markets through vertical integration (VI) (Antinori, 2005; Gelo and Koch, 2014; Vega and Keenan, 2014).

From the decomposition analyses, our empirical results show that statistical 'discrimination' is the source of income disparity between male and female participants, accounting for 100 per cent of the total income differential, while the income disparity between high- and low-income participants is mainly due to the differences in endowments.

Table 6 and Table 7 indicate that the rich households are not all that dependent on common property resources although they use more natural resources in terms of quantity. Table 8 presents the regression results of the effect of income level on total NTFPs extraction and dependence on NTFPs. Regression of NTFPs income to total income and income squared shows that within a range of household income NTFPs extraction increases and then falls with the increase in total income. The second regression of ratio of NTFPs income to total income indicates that a householdÍs dependence decreases gradually with a higher income level. But the positive sign with income squared indicates that NTFPs dependence on forest decreases at an increasing rate. This means that very rich households seldom go to the forest for NTFPs collection.

First, we assess participation in terms of a more complete probability model using the theoretical insights of Agarwal (2001) by collecting data on all of the factors she argues are associated with women’s participation. Thus, we are able to test competing hypotheses meant to explain participation that more fully capture the relevant theoretical expectations. Second, while most of the previous literature surveys communities as the unit of analysis, we use household level survey data to compare the responsibility of women and men within the household. Specifically, we examine whether responsibilities for participation fall mostly upon the wife, husband, are equally shared, or whether there is no participation by the household at all.

However, parallel with this, there has been a reduction in fodder and firewood supplies (Malla 2000; Dhakal et al 2005), and household income, employment, and livestock holdings have decreased (Bhatta 2002; Timilsina 2003). Since wealthier households have sufficient private landholdings to produce their own fodder, the effects of these reductions appear to have been disproportionately felt by the poorest households, women, and minorities (Agrawal 2001; Adhikari et al 2004; Dhakal 2006; Maskey et al 2006).",0,1,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this program, the state and local communities jointly manage the state forests and share the benefits of increased forest resource stock and flow as a result of the management. Tumpang sari (TS), a temporal type of agroforestry, is a conventional way to provide such incentive.In TS, a parcel of state forestland is allocated to a farm household where members of that household plant teak trees and maintain the young trees for 2 years. TS attracts small or landless farmers in need of cultivation land who are dependent on forest resources for their livelihoods. In exchange for labor contributed toward planting and maintaining the trees, TS farmers receive a small cash payment and can keep all yields from intercropping of food crops such as maize (Zea mays indentata), peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), and cassava (Manihot esculenta). After 2 years, the farmers have to leave their TS parcel and can cultivate in a new parcel. A new social forestry program in the Gunung Kidul District namely Hutan Kemasyarakatan (HKM) was formulated in 2001 and established in 2002. Unlike in the conventional TS where food crop cultivation was allowed only for 2 years, in the HKM TS farmers were allowed to cultivate a parcel in state forestland for 25 years.

What unites these approaches, however, is that they typically aim to combine elements that link conservation with development, engage local communi- ties as active stakeholders, and/or devolve control over natural resources. The shared rationale is that promoting socio-economic benefits, either directly or by compen- sating the costs associated with conservation, is import- ant in both its own right, and as a key strategy for slowing deforestation and protecting endangered habi- tats and species.
