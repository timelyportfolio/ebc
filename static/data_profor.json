Households with supplementary income in addition to their income from agriculture are more likely to participate in user groups created by the PPP (coefficient = 0.477, significant at the 10% level). Similarly, households that own more land are more likely to participate to a greater extent in the groups created by the program (coefficient = 0.004, significant at the 5% level). Both the social variables are statistically significant. The high statistical significance of the caste variable confirms the hypothesis that lower-caste members participate relatively less in the user groups created by the PPP (coefficient = 0.554, significant at the 1% level). The education variable has a negative sign and is statistically significant (coefficient = -0.012, significant at the 5% level). This indicates that the higher the average number of years of education of the adult members in a household, the lower the likelihood of the household participating in the program.Of the two variables related to benefits from the resource (firewood and fodder), firewood is statistically significant. This means that as anticipated, households that use higher amounts of firewood from the forest are also more likely to try to participate in the program and to influence decision making in local groups through participation (coefficient = 0.1, statistically significant at the 5% level).

However, there are pervasive imperfections in forest products markets that constrain the needed incentives; these imperfections arise mainly from limited infrastructure, high transport costs, few buyers, exploitive marketing chains and imperfect price information. One innovative approach to overcome these problems, which has been adopted by the Ethiopian government, is to organize JFM into community forest enterprises (CFE) in the form of forest usersÍ cooperatives (FUC) for forest products marketing.4 This provides the community with avenues for greater participation in value chains of forest products markets through vertical integration (VI) (Antinori, 2005; Gelo and Koch, 2014; Vega and Keenan, 2014).

At the same time, the local people who used to be treated as encroacher of forests and forest resources, are motivated to stop their destruction of the forest. As a result of their off farm family labour they are active beneficiaries of the programme.

First, we assess participation in terms of a more complete probability model using the theoretical insights of Agarwal (2001) by collecting data on all of the factors she argues are associated with women’s participation. Thus, we are able to test competing hypotheses meant to explain participation that more fully capture the relevant theoretical expectations. Second, while most of the previous literature surveys communities as the unit of analysis, we use household level survey data to compare the responsibility of women and men within the household. Specifically, we examine whether responsibilities for participation fall mostly upon the wife, husband, are equally shared, or whether there is no participation by the household at all. Third, we then extend this analysis to examine what effects the different configurations of participation have on institutional outcomes from the forest user groups (FUGs). Fourth, our data analysis uses data from a household survey administered in Bolivia, Kenya, Mexico, and Uganda and thus provides an extension of the previous literature to these countries.

As a result, since the mid-1990s, forest cover has been improved by the establishment of exclosures (e.g. Asefa et al. 2003) and woodlots (Jagger & Pender 2003), as well as agroforestry, land certification for use, and integrated soil and water management (Haile et al. 2006). In addition, some land rehabilitation activities have been undertaken via food-for-work schemes.' 'In 1991, the idea of dividing the degraded and unproductive communal hillsides into smaller plots and allocating them to individuals for tree planting was initiated by local communities. Community elders and priest farmers described their ideas through the use of chronological depictions of interventions intended to provide solutions to degraded hillsides, and showed a timeline for the pro- posed activities. In this way, members of the local communities were able to express their wishes for the hills to become productive once again and hence transform their livelihoods. The demand-driven initiative was sub- sequently put into practice by local administrators and influenced both the regional land policy and the national land policy.

In principle, community forestry transfers management responsibility to local communities, allowing them to make decisions appropriate to the community and to capture the benefits of their decisions. In practice afforestations occurred in community pasturelands. Livestock grazing and controlled forest collection were restricted (Dhakal et al., 2005; Bhatta 2000). The government also introduced the Forest Amendment Act in 1998 and a mandatory forest inventory introduced to regulate forest uses and contribute to global environmental conservation, including global climate change mitigation as directed by “Sustainable Forestry” in Agenda 21.

Since wealthier households have sufficient private landholdings to produce their own fodder, the effects of these reductions appear to have been disproportionately felt by the poorest households, women, and minorities (Agrawal 2001; Adhikari et al 2004; Dhakal 2006; Maskey et al 2006).","Stated_model":"","PRIME":"Rights","Model_use":"NA"},{"aid":223,"Authors":"Djamhuri T","Pub_year":"2008","geo":[{"Study_country.x":"Indonesia","id":360,"region":"Asia","subregion":"South-Eastern Asia"}],"outcome":[{"Out_type.inc_con":"1","Out_type.cap_asset":"0","Indicators":"HKM member benefit–cost ratio and internal rate of return of teak growing","Outcome.data_type":"Quantitative","Outcome.direction":"Positive","Outcome.direction_notes":"Yes, the IRR is greater for the forest groups that selected a greater share of timber generated; benefit-cost ratios are lower for those groups and higher for groups selecting the lower share of timber generated.","Out_subtype":"mon_dir","Out_type_assigned":"inc_con"},{"Out_type.inc_con":"1","Out_type.cap_asset":"0","Indicators":"HKM member benefit–cost ratio and internal rate of return of teak growing","Outcome.data_type":"Quantitative","Outcome.direction":"Positive","Outcome.direction_notes":"Yes, the IRR is greater for the forest groups that selected a greater share of timber generated; benefit-cost ratios are lower for those groups and higher for groups selecting the lower share of timber generated.","Out_subtype":"phys_cons","Out_type_assigned":"inc_con"}],"intervention":[{"Int_type":"for_mgmt"},{"Int_type":"agrofor"},{"Int_type":"emp"}],"study":"non_exp","habitat":[{"Biome.":"NA"}],"comparator":[{"Comps_type":"other"}],"Assessor":"Kavita Macleod","Pub_type":"Peer-reviewed published journal article","Title":"Community participation in a social forestry program in Central Java, Indonesia: the effect of incentive structure and social capital","Journal":"Agroforest Syst","Vol":"74","Page_num":"83–96","Author_affil":"Laboratory of Agricultural History, Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan","Funding":"This work was supported by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science and Directorate General of Higher Education Core University Program in Applied Biosciences.","Linked_refs":"","Affil_type":"academic","Stated_int":"Social forestry program: A new social forestry program has been implemented in Java to overcome encroachment of state forests. In this program, the state and local communities jointly manage the state forests and share the benefits of increased forest resource stock and flow as a result of the management. Tumpang sari (TS), a temporal type of agroforestry, is a conventional way to provide such incentive.In TS, a parcel of state forestland is allocated to a farm household where members of that household plant teak trees and maintain the young trees for 2 years. TS attracts small or landless farmers in need of cultivation land who are dependent on forest resources for their livelihoods. In exchange for labor contributed toward planting and maintaining the trees, TS farmers receive a small cash payment and can keep all yields from intercropping of food crops such as maize (Zea mays indentata), peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), and cassava (Manihot esculenta). After 2 years, the farmers have to leave their TS parcel and can cultivate in a new parcel. A new social forestry program in the Gunung Kidul District namely Hutan Kemasyarakatan (HKM) was formulated in 2001 and established in 2002. Unlike in the conventional TS where food crop cultivation was allowed only for 2 years, in the HKM TS farmers were allowed to cultivate a parcel in state forestland for 25 years. They would plant their parcels with teak trees, maintain them, and share the timber with the state. Long-term usufruct rights for farming activities on state forestland and timber sharing are the new arrangements introduced in the HKM.","Desired_out":"To reduce encroachment in state forests","Int_dur":"Since 2001","Int_geo":"subnational","Impl_type":"pub_sect","Study_goal":"This article aims to investigate the complete incentive structure of the social forestry program and how the incentive structure changes community member participation in forest management.
